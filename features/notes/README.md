# Notes Feature

The Notes feature lets users capture and manage relationship context.

## Explanation
Notes provide memory for each contact. A user can add manual notes, pin important details, and tag entries for quick recall.  
AI support enhances this by generating summaries, extracting entities, and suggesting next steps.  
This makes follow-ups more relevant and prevents losing track of past interactions.

## What it does
- Create, edit, and delete notes linked to contacts
- Attach notes to multiple contacts
- Pin and tag notes for organization
- Use voice-to-text input for fast capture
- Get AI-generated summaries and next-step suggestions
